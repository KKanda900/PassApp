# How it works
PassApp allows users to create secure passwords easily and convenient. In addition, PassApp allows users to send passwords over the internet in a secure way using RSA encryption/decryption algorithms. Using ElectronJS and cryptography, PassApp is able to create a secure interface for all your password needs. 

## Data Structures Used 
PassApp utilizes a tree data structure to create a random password that can range from 0-1 million characters (or even beyond 1 million characters) in length. A tree data structure was suited to be the best option because compared to random generation it is more convenient and better in speed.
